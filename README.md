Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs. This is achieved by training a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset. It consists of 25,000 color images of cats and dogs (12,500 images each for cats and dogs). The dataset is split into training and validation sets.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-vs-dog-classification.git
cd cat-vs-dog-classification
Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluate the model:
bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
Model Architecture
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
MaxPooling layers
Fully connected (Dense) layers
Dropout layers for regularization
Output layer with softmax activation
Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, shifts, and flips are applied to improve the model's generalization.

Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation set. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's performance.

Results
After training, the model achieves the following performance on the validation set:

Accuracy: 97%
Precision: 96%
Recall: 97%
F1-score: 96%
